I am an undergraduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I am interested in machine learning and programming languages.
I am a research assistant of Professor [Ramya Korlakai Vinayak](https://ramyakv.github.io), working on implementing crowd-sourcing algorithms and building web backend that runs these algorithms. Besides doing research, I am also a peer mentor for [CS540](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jphanna/teaching/2021fall_cs540), Introduction to Artificial Intelligence.
