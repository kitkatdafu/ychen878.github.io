First and foremost, I want to sincerely apologize. In hindsight, I realize that my actions and decisions were not in alignment with the values and trust we've built in our friendship. I understand now that I betrayed your trust, and for that, I am truly sorry. The realization of how my actions might have hurt you deeply saddens me.

Reflecting on our time together, I also recognize that I should have devoted more time to our friendship. The moments we shared have always been precious to me, and I regret not making them more of a priority. Our friendship means the world to me, and I deeply regret not showing that through my actions.
