The first one is to calculate the representatives (centroids) of a given partition. The second one is to find the partition based on the representatives.
Inputs Suppose we have a dataset looks like this:
1dataset = np.array([[5, 6], 2 [6, 5], 3 [0, 1], 4 [1, 0], 5 [3, 3]]) Each row in this dataset matrix is an observation and each column in this matrix represents a feature.</description></item><item><title>Decimal Numbers</title><link>https://www.mrr1vfe.io/posts/decimal-numbers/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.mrr1vfe.io/posts/decimal-numbers/</guid><description>Notes on Rust in Action, by Tim McNamara
Scientific Notation \[3.14 \times 10 ^ 8 \]
::Sign:: representing positive or negative ::Mantissa:: 3.14 ::Radix:: 10 ::Exponent:: 8 Floating Point Computers use scientific notation in memory to represent floating point numbers. A floating number in memory is constitutive of 3 parts
::Sign:: ::Mantissa:: ::Exponent:: The ::radix:: is predefined to be 2 and therefore does not need to be stored.</description></item><item><title>Lifetimes, Ownership, and Borrowing</title><link>https://www.mrr1vfe.io/posts/lifetimes-ownership-borrowing/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.mrr1vfe.io/posts/lifetimes-ownership-borrowing/</guid><description>Notes on Rust in Action, by Tim McNamara
Lifetimes, ownership, and boring are the three essential aspect of the borrow checking system, which is the bedrock of Rust’s fearless concurrency.
Behavior of primitive types Primitive types in Rust implement the Copy trait, which allows these types “to be duplicated at times that would otherwise be illegal”. Primitive types follow the copy semantics, whereas other types follow the move semantics. In fact, all types that implement Copy trait follow the copy semantics.</description></item><item><title>Global variables</title><link>https://www.mrr1vfe.io/posts/global-variables/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.mrr1vfe.io/posts/global-variables/</guid><description>Notes on Rust in Action, by Tim McNamara
All caps If mutable, it’s modifier is static mut, meaning the variable has a mutable static lifetime (valid for the life of the program). If immutable, use const instead. Code that modify global variable should be placed into an unsafe block. unsafe means as safe as C.
const vs. let Although let also defines immutable variable, it defines run time constant.</description></item><item><title>Struct, Enum</title><link>https://www.mrr1vfe.io/posts/struct-enum/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.mrr1vfe.io/posts/struct-enum/</guid><description>Notes on Rust in Action, by Tim McNamara
type Just an aliasing mechanism. For example, the following code will compile and run:
1type MyString = String; 2fn main() { 3 let haha: MyString = String::from(&amp;#34;haha&amp;#34;); 4 let hehe: String = MyString::from(&amp;#34;hehe&amp;#34;); 5} “new type” struct wrapping If aliasing is not ideal, try this:
1struct MyString(String); // a tuple Now, the following code will not compile since MyString and String are no longer interchangeable.</description></item><item><title>Arrays, slices, and vectors</title><link>https://www.mrr1vfe.io/posts/arrays-slices-vectors/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.mrr1vfe.io/posts/arrays-slices-vectors/</guid><description>Notes on Rust in Action, by Tim McNamara
Arrays A collection of same thing (type). Size is not changeable. Size is known at compile time. Unlike arrays in Java, arrays in Rust are allocated on stack. Array initialization Comma-delimited list within square brackets [8, 9, 6, 4] Repeat expression [5; 10]: An array contains ten 5s. Type annotation Similar to the repeat expression [type; size], the left hand side is the type of individual element, and the right hand side is the size of the array.</description></item><item><title>Reading from user input</title><link>https://www.mrr1vfe.io/posts/reading-from-user-input/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.mrr1vfe.io/posts/reading-from-user-input/</guid><description>Notes on Rust in Action, by Tim McNamara

Numbers Rust supports operator overloading. Therefore, operators like + can be used on different types, not only numbers (Java does not support it).
There is not implicit conversion between types. i32 is always i32 unless otherwise indicated.
Numbers have methods. But the type of a number must be specified.
To print the binary representation of a number, use {:b} as the placeholder for the number.</description></item><item><title>Understanding, Analysis, and Comparison of Convolutional Neural Network Architecture</title><link>https://www.mrr1vfe.io/posts/ece532-final-project/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.mrr1vfe.io/posts/ece532-final-project/</guid><description>Understanding, Analysis, and Comparison of Convolutional Neural Network Architecture A final project for ECE532

Introduction [Yi Chen, Yuehan Qin]
Neural networks, which are widely applied in deep learning, are inspired by neuron connectivity patterns that are similar to animal cortex structure. A specialized neural network, convolutional neural network (CNN), takes the advantage of &amp;quot;convolution operation&amp;quot;. This operation, realized by a kernel or a filter, calculates the weighted sum of pixel information in a certain area defined by the size of the kernel.</description></item><item><title>Matrix Methods in Machine Learning</title><link>https://www.mrr1vfe.io/posts/cs532/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.mrr1vfe.io/posts/cs532/</guid><description>Unit 2 Linear Independence and Rank in Learning Linear independence A set of $M$ vectors $v_1, v_2, \cdots, v_m \in \mathbb{R}^N$ is linear independent if and only if \[\sum^M_{i=1} v_i\alpha_i = 0 \Leftrightarrow \alpha_i = 0, i = 1, 2, \cdots M.\] Otherwise, it&amp;#39;s called linearly dependent. A matrix multiplication of $Aw = d$ can be interpreted as the linear combination of the columns of $A$, where the weight for the $i^\text{th}$ column is the $i^\text{th}$ element of $w$.</description></item><item><title>Compiling C code using GCC</title><link>https://www.mrr1vfe.io/posts/gcc-compiling/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.mrr1vfe.io/posts/gcc-compiling/</guid><description>Basic compilation using GCC 1gcc matrix.c This command outputs a executable binary named a.out, which can be executed in the shell by ./a.out.

OS providing abstraction has a variety of advantages. It allows applications to reuse common facilities; it makes different devices look the same; and it provides higher-level or more useful functionality. The challenges of OS providing abstraction are identifying the correct abstraction and deciding how much of hardware should be exposed.</description></item><item><title>Notes on The Rust Programming Language</title><link>https://www.mrr1vfe.io/posts/trpl/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.mrr1vfe.io/posts/trpl/</guid><description>Common Programming Concepts 1 Variables and Mutability The default integer type for a positive number that is not so large is i32.
Variables by default are immutable.
Differences Between Variables and Constants mut cannot be used with constants.
Declare constants with const keyword, and the type must be annotated.
Constant can only be set to constant expression, not value computed during runtime.</description></item><item><title>Theory and Design of Programming Languages</title><link>https://www.mrr1vfe.io/posts/cs538/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.mrr1vfe.io/posts/cs538/</guid><description>Lecture 1 1 Functional programming History Based on $\lambda$ calculus

Building block function take inputs as arguments and produce outputs.
Functions are first class, like any other value. They can be passed to, returned by functions. Functions can also be combined into new function.</description></item><item><title>Memory and Cache Review</title><link>https://www.mrr1vfe.io/posts/memory-and-cache-review/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.mrr1vfe.io/posts/memory-and-cache-review/</guid><description>Locality Principle of locality Programs tend to use data and instructions with addresses near or equal to those they have recently used.
temporal locality Recently referenced items are likely to be referenced again in the near future.
spatial locality Items with nearby addresses tend to be referenced close together in time.
