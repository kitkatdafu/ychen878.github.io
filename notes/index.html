<a href=/notes/pla/><p>Given a dataset \(\mathcal{D} = \{(\vec{x}_1, y_1), \cdots, (\vec{x}_N, y_N)\}\) and a hypothesis set \(\mathcal{H}\), our learning algorithm \(\mathcal{A}\) tries to learn a function \(g \in \mathcal{H}\) that approximates the underlying, true function \(f: \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}\), which generates the points in \(\mathcal{D}\).
Credit Card Approve Problem Given a customer who is applying for a credit card, we want to build a system that determines if we should grant the application or not based on the customer's information such as age, annual salary, year in job, etc.</p></a></p><p><h3><a href=/notes/clustering/>Clustering</a></h3><i></i>

<a href=/notes/clustering/><p>In unsupervised learning, there are no labels associated with features. Generally speaking, the ultimate goal of unsupervised learning is to find patterns and structures that help us to better understand data. Sometimes, we also use unsupervised learning to model a distribution. But we generally will not make predictions.
There are 3 types of clustering 1. Partitional (centroid, graph-theoretic, spectral) 1. Hierarchical (agglomerative, divisive) 2. Bayesian (decision-based, non-parametric)
Partitional Clustering \(k\)-means \(k\)-means is a type of partitional centroid-based clustering algorithm.</p></a></p><p><h3><a href=/notes/k-means/>K-means in Python</a></h3><i></i>

<a href=/notes/k-means/><p>There are two major steps in the K-means algorithm. The first one is to calculate the representatives (centroids) of a given partition. The second one is to find the partition based on the representatives.
Inputs Suppose we have a dataset looks like this:
dataset = np.array([[5, 6], [6, 5], [0, 1], [1, 0], [3, 3]]) Each row in this dataset matrix is an observation and each column in this matrix represents a feature.</p></a></p></div><p>Copyright (c) 2023 Yi Chen</p><script>MathJax={tex:{inlineMath:[["$","$"],["\\(","\\)"]]},svg:{fontCache:"global"}}</script><script src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script>
