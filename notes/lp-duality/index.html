$$
\begin{align}
\max_{f, s} &\quad 12f + 9s \
\st &\quad 4f + 2s \leq 4800 \
&\quad f + s \leq 1750 \
&\quad 0 \leq f \leq 1000 \
&\quad 0 \leq s \leq 1500 \
\end{align}
$$
Suppose the maximum profit is $p^\star$. How can we bound $p^\star$? The lower bound of $p^\star$ can be found by picking any feasible point (since maximization). For example,
${f=0, s=0}$ is feasible. Therefore, $p^\star \geq 12f + 9s = 0$. Since any feasible point yields a lower bound of $p^\star$ and $p^\star$ itself is yielded by an feasible point, then finding the largest lower bound of $p^\star$ is equivalent to solving the LP.</p><p>The upper bound of $p^\star$ can be found using the constraints. For example, since $f$ and $s$ need to be less than $1000$ and $1500$ respectively, $p^\star \leq 12 \cdot 1000 + 9 \cdot 1500 = 25500$. We can include more constraints and have $p^\star \leq f + (4f + 2s) + 7(f + s) \leq 1000 + 4800 + 7 \cdot 1750 = 18050$. There are many different ways to combine these constraints to yield an upper bound of $p^\star$. We need to find the best way of combining these constraints so that it yields the best upper bound. To achieve this goal, we can choose 4 multipliers $\lambda_{1}, \lambda_{2}, \lambda_{3}, \lambda_{4} \geq 0$ to be the multipliers of our 4 constraints. We want the 4 multipliers to satisfy the following inequality, for any feasible $f$ and $s$,
$$
12f + 9s \leq \lambda_{1}(4f + 2s) + \lambda_{2}(f + s) + \lambda_{3}f + \lambda_{4}s.
$$
Note that we can rearrange this inequality and obtain
$$
0 \leq (4\lambda_{1} + \lambda_{2} + \lambda_{3} - 12)f + (2\lambda_{1} + \lambda_{2} + \lambda_{4} - 9)s.
$$
Since the original problem is an LP, $f$ and $s$ have to be non-negative. Hence, to satisfy the inequality above, all we need to have is to satisfy
$$
4\lambda_{1} + \lambda_{2} + \lambda_{3} - 12 \geq 0
$$
and
$$
2\lambda_{1} + \lambda_{2} + \lambda_{4} - 9 \geq 0.
$$
The $\lambda$&rsquo;s that satisfy the constraints above yield an upper bound of $p^\star$
$$
p^\star \leq 4800 \lambda_{1} + 1750 \lambda_{2} + 1000 \lambda_{3} + 1500 \lambda_{4}.
$$
Finding the smallest upper bound would be yet another LP, i.e.
$$
\begin{align}
\min_{\lambda_{1}, \lambda_{2}, \lambda_{3}, \lambda_{4}} &\quad 4800 \lambda_{1} + 1750 \lambda_{2} + 1000 \lambda_{3} + 1500 \lambda_{4}. \
\st &\quad 4f + 2s \leq 4800 \
&\quad 4\lambda_{1} + \lambda_{2} + \lambda_{3} - 12 \geq 0 \
&\quad 2\lambda_{1} + \lambda_{2} + \lambda_{4} - 9 \geq 0 \
&\quad \lambda_{1}, \lambda_{2}, \lambda_{3}, \lambda_{4} \geq 0 \
\end{align}.
$$</p><h1 id=primal-and-dual>Primal and Dual</h1><p>The first maximization problem is called the primal problem. The second minimization problem is called the dual problem. The $\lambda$&rsquo;s in the dual problem are called the dual variable, and there is a dual variable corresponding to each constraint in the primal problem. Similarly, each constraint in the dual problem corresponds to a primal variable as well. Let $p^\star$ and $d^\star$ denote the optimal for the primal and the dual respectively. Then, they should satisfy the following inequality
$$
(\text{any feasible primal point}) \leq p^\star \leq d^\star \leq (\text{any feasible dual point}).
$$
In general, a primal problem $(P)$ is stated as
$$
\begin{align}
\max_{x} &\quad c^Tx \
\st &\quad Ax \leq b \
&\quad x \geq 0
\end{align}
$$
and a dual problem $(D)$ is stated as
$$
\begin{align}
\min &\quad b^T\lambda \
\st &\quad A^T\lambda \geq c \
&\quad \lambda \geq 0
\end{align}.
$$
If $x$ and $\lambda$ are feasible points of $(P)$ and $(D)$, then
$$
c^Tx \leq p^\star \leq d^\star \leq b^T\lambda.
$$
If $p^\star$ and $d^\star$ exist and are finite, then $p^\star = d^\star$. This property is known as strong duality.</p><h1 id=properties-of-lp-duality>Properties of LP Duality</h1><ol><li>$(P)$ and $(D)$ are both feasible and bounded, and $p^\star = d^\star$</li><li>$(P)$ is unbounded and $(D)$ is infeasible, $p^\star = \infty$ and $d^\star = \infty$</li><li>$(P)$ is infeasible and $(D)$ is unbounded, $p^\star = -\infty$ and $d^\star = -\infty$</li><li>$(P)$ is infeasible and $(D)$ is infeasible, $p^\star = -\infty$ and $d^\star = \infty$</li><li>The dual of the dual is the primal</li></ol><h1 id=duality-and-sensitivity>Duality and Sensitivity</h1><p>Duality is related to the idea of sensitivity: how much each of your constraints affect the optimal cost.</p><h1 id=complementary-slackness>Complementary Slackness</h1><p>At the optimal point, some inequality constraints become tight. Some inequality constraints may remain loose, even at optimality. These constraints have slack. Either a primal constraint is tight or its dual variable is zero. Either a dual constraint is tight or its primal variable is zero. These properties are called complementary slackness. We can use complementary slackness to check if a proposed point is optimal or not.</p></div><footer><p>Copyleft (â†„) 2024 Yi Chen</p><p><a href="mailto: yi.chen@wisc.edu">yi.chen@wisc.edu</a></p></footer><script>MathJax={tex:{inlineMath:[["$","$"],["\\(","\\)"]],macros:{vec:["\\mathbf{#1}",1],vx:"\\vec{x}",vw:"\\vec{w}",sign:"\\textrm{sign}",norm:[`\\left\\lVert#1\\right\\rVert`,1],st:"\\textrm{subject to:}"}},svg:{fontCache:"global"}}</script><script src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script><script id=MathJax-script async src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js></script></body></html>
