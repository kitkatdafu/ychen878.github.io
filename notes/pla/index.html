\(\mathcal{D} = \{(\vec{x}_1, y_1), \cdots, (\vec{x}_N, y_N)\}\) and a
hypothesis set \(\mathcal{H}\), our learning algorithm \(\mathcal{A}\)
tries to learn a function \(g \in \mathcal{H}\) that approximates the
underlying, true function \(f: \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}\), which
generates the points in \(\mathcal{D}\).</p><div id=outline-container-credit-card-approve-problem class=outline-3><h3 id=credit-card-approve-problem>Credit Card Approve Problem</h3><div id=outline-text-credit-card-approve-problem class=outline-text-3><p>Given a customer who is applying for a credit card, we want to build a
system that determines if we should grant the application or not based
on the customer's information such as age, annual salary, year in job,
etc. The bank's historical credit approval data can be seen as a dataset
\(\mathcal{D} = \{(\vec{x}_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^N\)where each
\(\vx_i \in \mathcal{X}\) and each represents a customer. There is a
target function \(f: \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}\) that gives \(\vx\)'s
credit behavior \(f(\vec{x}) = y\). Each \(\vx\) is a multidimensional
vector where each component is a feature (age, for example). Our
learning algorithm \(\mathcal{A}\) considers a hypothesis class
\(\mathcal{H}\) and takes the dataset \(\mathcal{D}\) and tries to give
a function \(g \in \mathcal{H}\) so that \(g\) performs similar to
\(f\). We will use \(g\) as our system of approving credit card.</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-perceptron-hypothesis class=outline-3><h3 id=perceptron-hypothesis>Perceptron Hypothesis</h3><div id=outline-text-perceptron-hypothesis class=outline-text-3><p>Let \(\vec{x} = (x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_d)\) be a customer, we compute a
weighted score \(\sum^d_{i=1} w_ix_i\) such that if the weighted score
is greater than a threshold \(t\), we approve the credit card, otherwise
we don't. Furthermore, suppose \(\mathcal{Y} = \{+1, -1\}\) where \(+1\)
means good credit and \(-1\) means bad credit, then
\(h \in \mathcal{H}\) looks like \[
h(\vec{x}) = \sign\left( \left( \sum^d_{i=1} w_ix_i \right) - t\right)
\] The \(h\) here depends on, or is parametrized by \(\{w_i\}\) and
\(t\). We call the set of all possible \(h\) (the set of all possible
combination of \(\{w_i\}\) and t) is called perceptron.</p><p>Observe that we can move \(t\) into the summation by extending \(w_i\)
and \(x_i\) so that \(w_0 = -t\) and \(x_0 = 1\). Then, we can write the
summation as an inner product: \[
h(\vx) = \sign(\vec{w}^T\vx).
\] Essentially, this \(\vec{w}\) represents a hypothesis. We now assume
that \(\vec{w}\) always includes the (negative) threshold \(t\).</p><div id=outline-container-perceptron-in-mathbbr2 class=outline-4><h4 id=perceptron-in-mathbbr2>Perceptron in \(\mathbb{R}^2\)</h4><div id=outline-text-perceptron-in-mathbbr2 class=outline-text-4><p>In \(\mathbb{R}^2\), \(\vx = [x_1 \quad x_2]^T\), then, the hypothesis
is \[
h(\vx) = \sign(w_0 + w_1x_1 + w_2x_2.)
\] We can plot all \(\vx\) in the dataset in a graph. Moreover, we use
\(\circ\) to represent \(+1\) and \(\times\) to represent \(-1\).
Besides, observe that \(w_0 + w_1x_1 + w_2x_2\) is a line.
\(h(\vx) = +1\) if \(\vx\) lies on one side of the line, and \(-1\)
otherwise on the other side. Since the perceptron is essentially using a
line to make a decision, we also call such a hypothesis class linear
binary classifier.</p></div></div></div></div><div id=outline-container-perceptron-learning-algorithm class=outline-3><h3 id=perceptron-learning-algorithm>Perceptron Learning Algorithm</h3><div id=outline-text-perceptron-learning-algorithm class=outline-text-3><p>With \(\mathcal{H}\), all possible perceptron, how to we select the best
of them, denoted as \(g\), such that \(g\) is close to \(f\), which we
never know. How do we decide which \(h \in \mathcal{H}\) should be our
\(g\), the best? Since \(\mathcal{D}\) is generated by \(f\), we ideally
want \[
g(\vx_i) = f(\vx_i) = y_i.
\] We can focus on finding the \(g\) that has this property. However, it
is difficult, since each \(h\) in \(\mathcal{H}\) is parametrized by a
line, and there are infinitely (uncountable) many candidates for us to
choose.</p><p>We can start from some \(g_0\), and iteratively corrects its mistakes on
\(\mathcal{D}\). We use \(\vec{w}_0\) represents \(g_0\) and say
\(\vec{w}_0 = \vec{0}\).</p><hr><p>Algorithm (Perceptron Learning Algorithm): For \(t = 0, 1, \ldots\) 1.
Find a mistake of \(\vec{w}_t\), called \((\vx_{n(t)}, y_{n(t)})\). By
mistake, we mean that \(\sign(\vec{w}^T_t\vx_{n(t)}) \ne y_{n(t)}\). 2.
We try to correct the mistake by
\(\vec{w}_{t + 1} \leftarrow \vec{w}_t + y_{n(t)}\vx_{n(t)}\). Until no
more mistakes Return the last \(\vec{w}\), called \(\vec{w}_{PLA}\) as
\(g\).</p><hr><p>Algorithm (Cyclic PLA): For \(t = 0, 1, \ldots\) 1. Find a mistake of
\(\vec{w}_t\), called \((\vx_{n(t)}, y_{n(t)})\). By mistake, we mean
that \(\sign(\vec{w}^T_t\vx_{n(t)}) \ne y_{n(t)}\). 2. We try to correct
the mistake by
\(\vec{w}_{t + 1} \leftarrow \vec{w}_t + y_{n(t)}\vx_{n(t)}\). Until a
full cycle (of \(\mathcal{D}\)) not encountering mistakes. Return the
last \(\vec{w}\), called \(\vec{w}_{PLA}\) as \(g\).</p><hr><p>Suppose there is a mistake at iteration \(t\), with instance \(\vx_n\).
We observe that \[
y_n\vec{w}^T_{t +1} \vx_n \ge y_n \vec{w}^T_t\vx_n
\] is always true. This shows that the algorithm is indeed trying to
correct the mistake. Why? Since it's a mistake,
\(\sign(\vec{w}_t^T \vx_n) \ne y_n\). Therefore,
\(y_n \vec{w}^T_t\vx_n\) is negative. \(y_n\vec{w}^T_{t +1} \vx_n\) is
greater than that means that it is trying to be positive, which is
correct.</p><p>We ponder, if the algorithm halts. If it halts, how does \(g\) perform
on the instances outside \(\mathcal{D}\)?</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-linear-separability class=outline-3><h3 id=linear-separability>Linear Separability</h3><div id=outline-text-linear-separability class=outline-text-3><p>If PLA halts, i.e.Â no more mistakes, then \(\mathcal{D}\) allows some
\(\vw\) to make no mistakes. We call such \(\mathcal{D}\) linear
separable. But given a linear separable \(\mathcal{D}\), will PLA halt?</p><p>\(\mathcal{D}\) is linear separable, is equivalent to there is an
omniscient \(\vw_f\) such that \(y_n = \sign(\vw^T_f \vx_n)\), for all
\(n\). In other word, \[
\min_n y_n \vw^T_f \vx_n > 0.
\] So, for any \(\vx_i\), \[
y_i\vw^T_f\vx_i \ge \min_ny_n\vw^T_f\vx_n > 0.
\] To measure the similarity between \(\vx_f\) and \(\vx_T\), learned at
step \(T\), we can use the inner product. The larger the inner product,
the closer the two vectors are. The following derivation shows that we
the algorithm runs from one iteration to the next, our learned line is
getting closer and closer to the true one. \[</p>\begin{align*}
\vw_f\vw_T &= \vw_f(\vw_{T-1} + y_{n(t)}\vx_{n(t)})\\
&= \vw_f\vx_{T-1} + y_{n(t)}\vw_f\vx_{n(t)} \\
&> \vw_f\vw_{T-1}
\end{align*}<p>\] If you are careful enough, you would say that the magnitude of inner
product also depends on the magnitude of the vector. This is true, we
would want \(\vec{w}_T\) to not grow too large as \(T\) goes large. \[</p>\begin{align*}
\norm{\vw_T}^2 &= \norm{\vw_{T-1} + y_{n(t)}\vx_{n(t)}}^2 \\
&= \norm{\vw_{T-1}}^2 + 2y_{n(t)}\vw_{T-1}^T\vx_{n(t)} + \norm{y_{n(t)}\vx_{n(t)}}^2\\
&\le \norm{\vw_{T-1}}^2 + \norm{y_{n(t)}\vx_{n(t)}}^2\\
&= \norm{\vw_{T-1}}^2 + \norm{\vx_{n(t)}}^2\\
&\le \norm{\vw_{T-1}}^2 + \max_n\norm{\vx_n}^2\\
\end{align*}<p>\] With this bound, suppose our \(\vw_0\) is the zero vector, then \[
\norm{\vw_T}^2 \le \norm{\vw_0}^2 + TR^2 = TR^2
\] where \(R^2 = \max_n \norm{\vx_n}^2\) (Consider \(R\) as the radius
of the dataset). Let
\(\rho = \min_n y_n \frac{\vw_f^T}{\norm{\vw_f}}\vx_n\) (closet distance
between \(\vx\) and \(\vw_f\), or margin) Hence, the normalized inner
product has the following property: \[</p>\begin{align*}
\frac{\vw^T_f}{\norm{\vw_f}}\frac{\vw_T}{\norm{\vw_T}} &\ge \frac{\vw^T_f}{\norm{\vw_f}}\frac{\vw_T}{\sqrt{TR^2}}\\
&= \frac{\vw^T_f}{\norm{\vw_f}}\frac{\vw_T}{\sqrt{T}R}\\
&= \frac{1}{\sqrt{T}R}\frac{\vw^T_f}{\norm{\vw_f}}\vw_T\\
&= \frac{1}{\sqrt{T}R}\frac{\vw^T_f}{\norm{\vw_f}}(\vw_0 + y_{n(0)}\vx_{n(0)} + y_{n(1)}\vx_{n(1)} + \cdots + y_{n(T-1)}\vx_{n(T-1)})\\
&= \frac{1}{\sqrt{T}R}\frac{\vw^T_f}{\norm{\vw_f}}(y_{n(0)}\vx_{n(0)} + y_{n(1)}\vx_{n(1)} + \cdots + y_{n(T-1)}\vx_{n(T-1)})\\
&\ge \frac{1}{\sqrt{T}R}T\rho\\
&= \frac{\sqrt{T}\rho}{R}.\\
\end{align*}<p>\] When normalized \(\vw_T\) is equivalent as the normalized \(\vw_f\),
their inner product would be 1, So, \[
1 \ge \frac{\sqrt{T}\rho}{R}.
\] Hence, \[
\sqrt{T} \le \frac{R}{\rho} \Longleftrightarrow T \le \frac{R^2}{\rho^2}.
\] This means that the number of iterations we find \(\vw_f\) is bounded
by \(R^2 /\rho^2\), which depends on the dataset and \(\vw_f\) itself
only. So, as long as the dataset is linear separable, PLA halts.</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-pros-and-cons-of-pla class=outline-3><h3 id=pros-and-cons-of-pla>Pros and Cons of PLA</h3><div id=outline-text-pros-and-cons-of-pla class=outline-text-3><p>Pros: It is simple to implement, fast, and works in any dimension \(d\).
Cons: We assume \(\mathcal{D}\) is linear separable. But, in reality,
this property is unknown in advance. Moreover, we are not fully sure how
long does the halting take. This is because \(\rho\) depends on
\(\vw_f\), which we never have access to in the first place. Therefore,
we run the PLA and observe that it does not halt for a long time. We
can't decide between if \(\mathcal{D}\) is not linear separable, or if
the algorithm is talking a long time to halt.</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-learning-with-noisy-data class=outline-3><h3 id=learning-with-noisy-data>Learning with Noisy Data</h3><div id=outline-text-learning-with-noisy-data class=outline-text-3><p>Taking a step back, we used to assume that \(\cal{Y}\) is generated by
applying the target function \(f\) on \(\mathcal{X}\). However, in
reality, there might be noises. So that
\(\cal{Y} = f(\cal{X}) + \text{noises}\). This means that noisy
\(\mathcal{D}\) could not linear separable, even though \(\cal{D}\) is.
How do we learn a \(\vw\) in this case?</p><p>First, we assume that the noise is little (which is reasonable), i.e. \[
y_n = f(\vx_n), \quad \text{usually}.
\] Therefore, if \(g \approx f\), then \[
y_n = g(\vx_n), \quad \text{usually}.
\] We want to find a line (hyperplane) \(\vw_g\) such that the number of
mistakes made on \(\mathcal{D}\) is minimized: \[
\vw_g \leftarrow \arg \min_\vw \sum^N_{n=1} \mathbb{1}_{[y_n \ne \sign(\vw^T\vx_n)]}.
\] Unfortunately, solving the optimization problem above is NP-hard.
However, we can modify PLA to get an approximately good \(g\).</p><hr><p>Algorithm (Pocket Algorithm): Initialize pocket weights \(\hat{\vw}\)
For \(t = 0, 1, \ldots\) 1. Find a (random) mistake of \(\vw_t\) called
\(\vw_{n(t), y_{n(t)}}\) 2. (Try to) correct the mistake by
\(\vw_{t + 1} \leftarrow \vw_t + y_{n(t)}\vw_{n(t)}\) 3. If
\(\vw_{t + 1}\) makes fewer mistakes than \(\hat{\vw}\), replace
\(\hat{\vw}\) by \(\vw_{t + 1}\) Until enough iterations. Return
\(\hat{\vw}\) (called \(\vw_{POCKET}\)) as \(g\)</p><hr></div></div></div><footer><p>Copyleft (â) 2023 Yi Chen</p><p><a href="mailto: yi.chen@wisc.edu">yi.chen@wisc.edu</a></p></footer><script>MathJax={tex:{inlineMath:[["$","$"],["\\(","\\)"]],macros:{vec:["\\mathbf{#1}",1],vx:"\\vec{x}",vw:"\\vec{w}",sign:"\\textrm{sign}",norm:[`\\left\\lVert#1\\right\\rVert`,1],st:"\\textrm{subject to:}"}},svg:{fontCache:"global"}}</script><script src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script><script id=MathJax-script async src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js></script></body></html>
