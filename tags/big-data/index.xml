&lt;p>Network Interface Controllers (NICs) can connect a computer to different physical mediums, such as Ethernet and Wi-Fi. Every NIC in the world has a unique MAC (media access control) address. It consists of 48 bits. Therefore, there are 28 trillion possible MAC addresses. Some devices randomly change their MAC address for privacy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can use command &lt;code>ifconfig&lt;/code> to check you network interface controller and its corresponding MAC address. There exists virtual interfaces as well. For example, &lt;code>lo&lt;/code>, the loopback device, is a virtual interface. It connects your computer to a mini network containing just your computer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docker</title><link>https://ychen878.github.io/notes/docker/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Feb 2023 22:49:32 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://ychen878.github.io/notes/docker/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="virtualization">Virtualization&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Virtualization is the illusion of private resources, provided by the software. We have virtual memory, virtual machine (hardware), virtual machine (languages), virtual operating system (container).&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Each process using a virtual address space is not aware of other processes using memory (illusion of private memory).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Virtualized resources include CPU, RAM, disks, network devices, etc. VMs rarely use all their allocated resources, so overbooking is possible. If each program is deployed to a different VM, operating system overheads dominate.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>JVM or PVM runs Java Bytecode and Python Bytecode. Programs written in Java and Python are compiled to their corresponding byte code instead of a specific machine code.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Virtual operating systems, or a containers, are run on a some flavor of Linux. You can have a container of Ubuntu and a container on Debian (but not Windows, since they are running on top of Linux). Containers are more efficient than virtual machines, but less flexible.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Containers and Virtual Machines are Sandboxes.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
