Variables by default are immutable. Differences Between Variables and Constants mut cannot be used with constants. Declare constants with const keyword, and the type must be annotated. Constant can only be set to constant expression, not value computed during runtime. Shadowing You can declare a new variable with the same name as a previous variable and the new variable shadows the previous variable.</description></item><item><title>Memory and Cache Review</title><link>https://www.mrr1vfe.io/posts/memory-and-cache-review/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.mrr1vfe.io/posts/memory-and-cache-review/</guid><description>Locality Principle of locality Programs tend to use data and instructions with addresses near or equal to those they have recently used.
temporal locality Recently referenced items are likely to be referenced again in the near future. spatial locality Items with nearby addresses tend to be referenced close together in time. Locality Example 1sum = 0; 2for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; n; i++) 3 sum += a[i]; 4return sum; Data References Reference array elements in succession (stride - 1 reference pattern).</description></item></channel></rss>
